This document's purpose is to clarify the different ways to record calibration data and which one is best

here are the different types of calibration:

Electrode placement :
    - electrodes in flat formation (-)

    - electrodes in A formation(A)

    - electrodes in V formation(V)

Events to record during calibration:
    - no events
    - clean blinks
    - fast blinks
